# This is documentation for the team app
## This app is designed to be an employee hub, within will contain the following:
* a weekly agenda that the employee can view for his or her department
* a news page that the company will be able to present company wide events
* a page that displays an employee's past hours
* a schedule page that shows the employee's current work schedule
* the employee profile page
# Main Page
The front page of the application that displays all the pages on it. This includes the profile, meetings/agenda, schedule, and the hours pages.
# Agenda/News Page
On this page you will find you own personal agenda for what you will be doing that workday.
Also you will find what events or news that will be occuring at the workplace.
If you would like to contact the front-office at the bottom of the page you will find a button to do so,
this will prompt you to a page that you will enter your name, email, department, and a place to send a messsage.

# Schedule Page
On this page the schedule displays the days and times in which the employee works. From there, clicking on any day in the list 
will take you a schedule detail page that has the day, time, work detail, and completion date. This for the purpose of keeping the employee notified of when they are working and when they are not. 

# Profile Page
On this page, the employee is shown their basic information, which includes their name, work ID, and their department. This page is intended to show the employee their personal information in which later iterations of the app would allow them to update it.
